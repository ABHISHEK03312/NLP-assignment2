# NLP-assignment2

The codes can be found in the file named NLP_Assignment2_Question2.ipynb. For NER, run this notebook.

The results of the models can be found under the respective folders: for example 1-CNN-layer, 2-CNN-layer and so on. 
  * Train, Test and Dev results can be found in their respective csv files. 

The Graphical representations for the results can be found in results-graphs.ipynb. For plotting the results from the csv files, run this notebook.

Instructions to run NER:
1. Open the file NLP_Assignment2_Question2.ipynb
2. Change necessary file paths such as the path for model saving, path for saving csvs.
3. Change necessary parameters such as:
 - word_mode which can take values "LSTM" or "CNN"
 - char_mode which can take values "LSTM" or "CNN"
 - cnn_layers which can take an integer value starting from 1
4. Run the notebook
